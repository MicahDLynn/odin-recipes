    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A latke is a type of potato pancake or fritter in Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine that is traditionally prepared to celebrate Hanukkah.</p>
    <h2 class="ingrediants">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="list-one">3 cups shredded potato</li>
        <li class="list-one">¼ cup grated onion</li>
        <li class="list-one">2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li class="list-one">6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>
        <li class="list-one">½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li class="list-one">¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li class="list-one">½ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="list-two">Mix potato, onion, eggs, crushed crackers, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li class="list-two">Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li class="list-two">Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first pressing potato mixture against the side of the bowl to remove excess liquid, into the hot oil; slightly flatten the latkes into the oil with the back of your spoon so they are an even thickness.</li>
        <li class="list-two">Cook in batches in the hot oil until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain latkes on a paper towel-line plate.</li>
